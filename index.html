            <div class="record-info__text__description">After the installation of the new wheels and conducting tests, we were met with disappointment due to the results obtained. Controlling the robot became notably more challenging as it began to drift in various directions. Additionally, the speed of the robot decreased due to the unique characteristics of the wheels and their inadequate grip on the surface.
              <br><br>Furthermore, we encountered another setback: all four motor outputs were already allocated for movement, leaving us with insufficient lifting power for the cubes. Taking into account these shortcomings and limitations, we collectively made the decision to revert back to the previous version of the robot.
              <br><br>By reverting to the old version, we aimed to regain the stability, control, and lifting capability that we had initially achieved. This choice allowed us to mitigate the issues associated with the new wheels and restore the robot's overall functionality and performance.
              <br><br>While the attempt to enhance the robot's speed and maneuverability through the new wheels did not yield the desired outcome, it served as a valuable learning experience for our team. It emphasized the importance of carefully considering the specific requirements and limitations of any modifications made to the robot's design and components.
